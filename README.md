# Assignments-Cluster
A repo for cool little assignments I find
---
## Usage
It will go like this:
1. I find a cool new puzzle/assignment and I decide to work on it.
2. It will have its own branch.
3. Each branch of an assignment will have the implementations I created for the programming languages I know/ decided to use.<br>
## Example
- Branch : tic tac toe
- Folder structure :<br>
  <b>assignment-doc</b><br>
  <b>c</b> /<br>
    main.c<br>
    additional code & files...<br>
  <b>py</b> /<br>
    main.py<br>
    additional code & files..<br>
  ... ( other langs )<br>
